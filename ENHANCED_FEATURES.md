## 🧠 Memory System

### Features
- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant information using natural language
- **Persistent Storage**: Memories survive across sessions
- **Automatic Categorization**: Conversations, tasks, preferences, facts
- **Context Retention**: Recent context enhances responses
- **Memory Consolidation**: Automatic cleanup of old, unused memories

### Usage Examples

```python
# Search memory
memory search "Python projects"
memory search "how to install"
memory search "error messages"

# Memory is automatically populated from:
# - Your conversations with Yuvan
# - Task execution results
# - Document processing results
# - System analysis results
```

### Memory Types
- **Conversation**: Chat history and interactions
- **Task**: Command executions and results
- **Preference**: User settings and preferences
- **Fact**: Learned information and insights
- **Reasoning**: Autonomous reasoning sessions
- **Planning**: Plans and strategies created

---

## 🤖 Autonomous Reasoning (ReAct Framework)

### How It Works
Yuvan uses the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) framework for autonomous problem-solving:

1. **THINK**: Analyze the problem and plan approach
2. **ACT**: Take specific actions to gather information
3. **OBSERVE**: Analyze results of actions
4. **PLAN**: Create next steps based on observations
5. **REFLECT**: Consider findings and implications
6. **COMPLETE**: Provide summary and recommendations

### Trigger Phrases
- `"Yuvan, fix <problem>"`
- `"Yuvan, analyze <item>"`
- `"analyze this <description>"`
- `"solve <problem>"`
- `"figure out <issue>"`

### Example Session
```
User: "Yuvan, fix this Python file that has import errors"

Yuvan: [Autonomous reasoning initiated]
THINK: I need to analyze the Python file for import errors
ACT: Analyzing file structure and imports
OBSERVE: Found missing module imports and circular dependencies
PLAN: Suggest specific fixes for each import issue
REFLECT: The fixes should resolve dependencies without breaking functionality
COMPLETE: Here are the specific import fixes needed...
```

# Check TTS status
status

# Reinstall TTS dependencies
pip install torch torchaudio

# Disable TTS if needed
# Set ENABLE_STREAMING_TTS = False
```

#### 2. OCR Errors
```bash
# Install Tesseract
# Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
# macOS: brew install tesseract
# Windows: Download from official site

# Check OCR availability
"process document test.pdf"
```

#### 3. Memory Issues
```bash
# Clear memory cache
"clear memory cache"

# Check memory statistics
"memory stats"

# Reset memory system
# Delete memory_storage/ folder
```

#### 4. Terminal Access Denied
```bash
# Some commands require permissions
# Use safe alternatives:
"run ls" instead of "run sudo ls"
"execute git status" instead of "execute rm -rf /"
```
