# **Yuvan AI Operational Assistant**

> **"Yuvan: Your AI partner for real-world task management, automation, and system guidance."**

---

## **Project Overview**

**Yuvan** is an **interactive AI assistant** designed to help users:

- **Interact via voice or text**  
- **Guide users through real-world tasks step by step**  
- **Assist with software/system design, coding, and debugging**  
- **Control hardware and IoT devices in future versions**

The long-term goal is to build an **AI agent that thinks, assists, and operates alongside you** in both digital and physical projects.

---

## **Current Development Phase**

We are focusing on the **software interaction layer first.**  
Hardware support (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino) will be added later.

---

## **Initial Development Tasks for AI Agent**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Voice/Text Interaction System**

- Integrate **speech-to-text** (Whisper API or similar)  
- Implement **text-to-speech output** (e.g., pyttsx3, gTTS)  
- Build a **CLI fallback mode** for text-based interactions  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Task Management Core**

- Create a **TaskHandler module** that can:  
  - Receive user commands  
  - Interpret tasks through natural language parsing  
  - Map inputs to system functions  
  - Provide appropriate responses or ask clarifying questions

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ AI Advisory Agent**

- Connect to an **LLM API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4o)**  
- Functions:  
  - Generate code, system designs, or plans on request  
  - Debug and explain system issues  
  - Provide recommendations for operational improvements

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Future Hardware Integration (Prepare the Structure)**

- Create placeholder modules/classes for:  
  - `IoTDeviceController` ‚Äì Controls hardware devices  
  - `HardwareTaskAdapter` ‚Äì Adapts user commands to physical device operations  
- Use **modular architecture** to ensure easy plug-in of hardware later  

---

## **Optional Enhancements (If Time Allows)**

- Implement **task logging/history**  
- Build a **context management system** for multi-step conversations  
- Add a **config system** to switch between local models, APIs, or hardware states
